## Cause

A message template passed to a logger API is not constant.

## Rule description

When performing logging, it's desirable to preserve the structure of the log (including placeholder names) along with the placeholder values. Preserving this information allows for better observability and search in log aggregation and monitoring software.

Preferred:

```csharp
var firstName = "Lorenz";
var lastName = "Smith";

// This will tell the logger that there are FirstName and LastName properties on the log message, and will correlate them with the values that are passed in
logger.Warning("Person {FirstName} {LastName} encountered an issue", firstName, lastName);
```

over:

```csharp
var firstName = "Bob";
var lastName = "Smith";

// Here, the log template itself is changing, and we will lose the association between named log properties and their values
logger.Warning("Person " + firstName + " " + {lastName} + " encountered an issue");

// Still an issue when using string interpolation
logger.Warning($"Person {firstName} {lastName} encountered an issue");
```

The logging message template should not vary between calls.

## How to fix violations

Update the message template to be a constant expression. If you're using values directly in the template, refactor them to use named placeholders instead.

```csharp
logger.Warning("Person {FirstName} {LastName} encountered an issue", firstName, lastName);
```

## When to suppress errors

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
